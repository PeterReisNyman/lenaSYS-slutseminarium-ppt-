Thu 15 May 2025 — Pull-request #17651 (HGustavs/LenaSYS)

You rewrote **sectionedService.md** inside *DuggaSys/microservices/Microservices Documentation*:

* Stripped out 1 127 lines of obsolete, multi-service notes that had ballooned into a wall of text.
* Added 79 crisp lines that properly document just the two micro-services that matter here:

  * **retrieveAllCourseVersions\_ms.php** – what it does, the required/optional parameters, call pattern (GET/POST), and the JSON it spits out.
  * **retrieveSectionedService\_ms.php** – same level of detail, plus a short example call.
* Net effect: a 1 206-line file slimmed down to something maintainable and actually readable. ([GitHub][1], [GitHub][2])

today i completed this https://github.com/HGustavs/LenaSYS/issues/16659 issue and subsequently created a pr. this was content of the issue:
Document inverse dependencies: readGroupValues_ms.php AND readUserDuggaFeedback_ms.php #16659 
We need to go through all the microservices and list their inverse dependencies. This is so we later can remove the includes. After finding all the inverse dependencies for these two files in /sectionedService, add it to the documentation-file with file DuggaSys/microservices/Microservices_inverse_dependencies.md

i found no inverse depnedacys in both files

=== log-2025-04-17.txt ===
today i did the following: 
## Inverse Dependencies

### insertIntoSQLite_ms.php

- Found 1 inverse dependency in /gitCommitService

### getCourseID_ms.php

- Found 0 inverse dependencies in /gitCommitService

refactor(gitCommitService): replace legacy includes with cURL-based

Removed every include_once statement from the seven *_ms.php files. Re-implemented data exchange with cURL:
  - GET requests now use CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER true and json_decode the response.
  - Fire-and-forget POST requests set CURLOPT_POST true and CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER false. Added \`header('Content-Type: application/json'); echo json_encode(...);\` to all receiving endpoints. Normalized \`$baseURL = "https://" . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'];\` path handling to keep dev/prod parity. Consolidated error reporting into consistent \`{ status, message }\` JSON objects. Deleted dead wrapper functions and ensured every script exits immediately after echoing JSON to prevent accidental output.

Issue: https://github.com/HGustavs/LenaSYS/issues/16861#event-17368098803

Re-engineer microservice clearGitFiles #16861  
Follow the "coding standard for removing includes" for this file in folder /gitCommitService.

**Log – 2025-04-24**

- Pulled latest `G2-2025-v4` branch of LenaSYS.  
- Followed wiki’s *Docker installation instructions* start-to-finish on M-series Mac (macOS 14).  
- Ran `docker-compose up --build`; build aborted with obsolete `version` warning and “no matching manifest for linux/arm64/v8” error (db/dbadmin images).  
- Stack never started → posted failure report on GitHub issue #16823 with full error output.

=== log-2025-04-28.txt ===
Today I started my morning by booting up my local XAMPP/LenaSYS environment and opening the courseed.php page. After that, I pulled down the updated microservice documentation template from issue #16824 and compared it side-by-side with our existing sharedMicroservices.md. Once I’d confirmed the docs matched the template, I dove into the logUserEvent_ms.php and retrieveUsername_ms.php files under /microservices/sharedMicroservices/, making sure each parameter, type, and example aligned exactly with the spec. Finally, I left a comment on GitHub approving the documentation—everything looks good and is in sync with issue #16824.

Daily Work Log — Monday, 12 May 2025

I worked on GitHub issue #17432, which required documenting the last two microservices in the sectioned-service folder. After reviewing the ticket, I duplicated the updated documentation template and produced two new files—removeListEntries_ms.md and reorderListEntries_ms.md—filling in accurate summaries, descriptions, parameter details, and expected responses. I then updated the sectioned-service documentation index to include both files.

To make sure the branch is ready for review, I opened the compare view and confirmed the diff renders correctly:
